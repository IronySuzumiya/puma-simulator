// In the results, look at the Accepted packet rate average = 0.00981771 (1 samples)
// If it's equal to injected packet rate, all good (no network buffers overflow)
// DPEsim assumes each packet put to send_queue is delivered after
// "Packet latency average = 81.7534" which'll hold true only iff
// accept_rate == injection_rate
